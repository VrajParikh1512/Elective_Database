# 🎓 Electives Database Management System

## 📘 Scenario Description

Choosing the right elective can be confusing for students due to limited information on course difficulty, grading trends, and professor quality, and sometimes lack of knowledge about interest.

- Read student reviews

It ensures **data-driven decision-making**, reducing uncertainty and helping students choose electives that align with their interests and academic goals.
